## Features and Capabilities

- **Automated Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images and videos effortlessly.
- **Sophisticated Face Recognition**: Implements a machine learning model using Eigenfaces and PCA for feature extraction, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the classification of faces.
- **Image Processing and Analysis**: Employs OpenCV for preprocessing images to enhance model accuracy.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Offers tools for training, testing, and evaluating the model's performance to ensure reliable face recognition.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses grid search to fine-tune the model for optimal results.
- **Flask Web Server**: A robust backend built in Python with Flask, capable of handling RESTful API requests.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a responsive front-end design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a seamless user experience.
- **REST API Creation**: Enables the development of REST APIs for easy client-side integration.
- **Deployment on Heroku**: The application is cloud-ready and deployed on Heroku for widespread accessibility.
- **Security and Privacy**: Designed with a focus on user data security and privacy best practices.

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Backend logic and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Web server and API development.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing.
- **Heroku**: Cloud deployment.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend design.
